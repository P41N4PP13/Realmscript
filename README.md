Realmscript
===========

An AHK (AutoHotKey) script for Realm of the Mad God

Among the features:
* Ctrl+right click sends right click
* Several text send hotkeys
* Ignore hotkey to ignore bots and shit (ignores the person who sent you a tell most recently)
* Teleport target (ctrl+n to set, Right Mouse Button to use)
* Pause hotkey
* "/tell mreyeball (stuff here)" hotkeys
* Nexus Tutorial hotkey
* Swap hotkeys (only works @ low res and with contextual click)
* /tp is converted to /teleport 
* Select all slots when trading
* Hotkey for charselection
* Ctrl+L for autologin on the frontpage

Some functionality only works at low resolution, if you want it working, do it yourself.
