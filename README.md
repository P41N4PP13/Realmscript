An AHK (AutoHotKey) script for Realm of the Mad God

Among the features:
* Shift+right click sends right click
* Several text send hotkeys

* Teleport target (ctrl+n to set, Right Mouse Button to use)
* Pause hotkey
* Nexus Tutorial hotkey
* Swap hotkeys (only works @ low res and with contextual click, because i want it to)
* Shift+scroll wheel scrolls chat log
* /tp is converted to /teleport 
* Select all slots when trading
* Withdraw/Deposit all items from vault
* Go to character/server select anywhere

Some functionality only works in chrome at low resolution, if you want it working, do it yourself.
